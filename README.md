# EE460J-final-project-league-predictor

This code and data is for Data Science Lab (EE460J). It is a colletion of code to:
1) Query the Riot API for League of Legends to gather Match data
2) Preprocess that data into a more useable format
3) Use that processed data to train many different machine learning models.
4) Create final models that can predict the outcome of a match based on periodic data and champion stats.

It is not well organized, but it's all there!
